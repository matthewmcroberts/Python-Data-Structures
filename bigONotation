"""Big O Notation"""


Inserting into an array is O(1) "Big O One"
Why?

Let T = the time it takes to complete
Let K = Constant
let N = The number of items managed (number of items in the array)
T=K is the equation for inserting
But K is a constant not needed, so it can be rewritten as T=1 or O(1)

Keep in mind:
O(1) is excellent (Items are managed in very few steps and stays consistent throughout)
O(log N) is good
O(N) is fair
O(N * log N) is poor
O(N^2) is bad (Items are managed in many steps rising exponentially)

Big O gives the slowest possible length something can run

Example:
    for()
        for()
            for()
    Each for loop is N, so three for loops is O(N^3) (So very bad)
