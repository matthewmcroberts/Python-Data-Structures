Ordered Linked Lists

Operations are similar to LinkedList

Operations:
 - Search: O(n)
 - Insert: O(n)
   - Unlike LinkedList, this cannot be O(1) all the time since it isn't guaranteed that the link is going to go to the
     beginning since it's supposed to be ordered
   - Inserting in a LinkedList/OrderedList is quicker than an ArrayList b/c we don't have to do any shifting of elements
 - Delete: O(n)
   - Unless you are removing the first link, then it's O(1)
